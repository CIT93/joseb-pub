# How to solve the water consumption inputs
One way i would do it is by adding a checkmark to see if the user has a washing machine. if it does then allow for selection, if not then disable the selection.

another way would be a selector to select dishwasher, washing machine or both. then the times ran per week. based on that input do the calculations.
