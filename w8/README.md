# Step by Step of my code
- first it checks if a table is created already with header
- if is not created then it starts creating the table element
- then creates the header
- after that it goes to the forEach function and start iterating through the array with the data or the key to create the header
- it keeps doing it until it reads all the data
- it shows the header in the site
- now it continues to the body of the table to create the rows
- tbody.innerHTML clears any previous data
- now the next foreach will iterate the data entered by the user
- it starts creating the cells
- finishing iterating the data then it creates the buttons
- the complete row now shows
- the form gets reset
